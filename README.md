**About Me**

Hello! My name is Don/Zukes, any nicknames are fine too ^_^.
I'm 17, Mexican, and have ADHD. I also have quite a bit of anxiety, so patience is appreciated.
I usually hang around the Phighting corner of Ponytown, although I'm often offtab or with friends. The best way to contact me is through whispering.
I may not see your message at times, mostly due to being offtab.
c+h are absolutely okay no matter what avatar I'm in! I appreciate any interaction in general a lot!
I can sometimes be crude with my jokes, please at any point tell me if you are uncomfortable and I will tone it down. Communication is very important to me.


I have a very strong attachment to my favorite characters, Zuka & Medkit, and I love hearing about others headcanons and thoughts on anybody else too!
My interests bring me a lot of joy and sharing it with others is even better. Talk to me anytime! I love making new friends ^_^!
